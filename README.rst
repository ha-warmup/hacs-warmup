Introduction
============

This is a library for communicating with a wifi-enabled home thermostat made by
`Warmup <https://www.warmup.co.uk/>`_. At the time of writing, this only 
includes the `warmup 4IE <https://www.warmup.co.uk/thermostats/smart/4ie-underfloor-heating>`_.

This code is inspired by a project for SmartThingsHub, see `here <https://github.com/alyc100/SmartThingsPublic/blob/master/devicetypes/alyc100/warmup-4ie.src/warmup-4ie.groovy>`_. Many Thanks to alyc100 for the great work!

Usage
=====
The library is primary intended to interface the 4IE with home assistant, but may also be used standalone.

Home Assistant
---------------

To setup this component, you need to register to warmup first.
see https://my.warmup.com/login

Then copy the contents of the `warmup` subfolder into custom_components 
in your HA **config** folder, e.g.:

.. code-block:: sh

  cd path/to/your/config

  git clone https://github.com/ha-warmup/warmup.git /tmp/warmup

  # remove any previous version
  rm -r ./custom_components/warmup 2>/dev/null
  mkdir -p ./custom_components/warmup
  cp -r /tmp/warmup/warmup_cc/* ./custom_components/warmup
  # clean up
  rm -rf /tmp/warmup/


NB: Previous versions of these instructions stated to use `warmup_cc`
however this is now simply `warmup`


Then add to your
configuration.yaml:

.. code-block:: yaml

  climate:
    - platform: warmup
      username: YOUR_E_MAIL_ADDRESS
      password: YOUR_PASSWORD

* **username** (required): the username used to login to the warmup web site
* **password** (required): the password used to login to the warmup web site; may be moved to the secrets.yaml file. See `secrets <https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/secrets/>`_

After restarting home assistant, the component will be loaded automatically.

Standalone
----------
You may install the library via pip using

>>> pip install warmup4ie

After that, import the library, and away we go.

    >>> import warmup4ie
    >>> warmup = warmup4ie.Warmup4IE('<e-mail>', '<password>',
    >>> warmup.get_all_devices()
    >>> device = warmup.get_device_by_name("Underfloor")
    >>> device.get_current_temperature()

Device Versions
---------------

Supported models:

- 4IE

Since I only have access to the 4IE, that is the model that the development 
has occured with. 

Supported Features
------------------

At the moment the library supports reading current temperature, target temperature plus other values from the thermostat
and setting the target temperature, switching between manual, automatic and frost protection mode, switching the device off.
and setting a temporary override.

For further information on versions please see the `CHANGELOG <https://github.com/ha-warmup/warmup/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>`_
