Warmup Plc manufacture underfloor heating and control systems and their wifi-enabled home thermostat, warmup 4IE, has a cloud-based API. This `hacs-warmup` HACS Integration enables communication via that API, and allows Home Assistant to read and control the device (currently just this one model). It is a Home Assistant 'custom component' using a python script to perform the integration.
