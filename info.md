# Deprecated

**This project is no longer being maintained**, 
as the contributors have now worked to 
integrate HACS compatibility into the main
ha-warmup repo at <https://github.com/ha-warmup/warmup/>

Please update your Home Assistant Community Store 
settings so that the Custom Repository for the Warmup integration now points to 

```
https://github.com/ha-warmup/warmup/
```

For Home Assistance integration 
with Warmup Plc manufactured
underfloor heating and control systems, such as 4IE and 6IE thermostats, please switch 
to the new custom repository above.
